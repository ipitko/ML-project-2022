# ML-project-2022
Course project for Machine Learning -course at Aalto University.

In this project, we were required to model a real-life application as a machine learning problem. We, me and my project partner, decided to investigate university student's mental health. We wanted to study student's mental health because they have had a hard time during the pandemic due to the lack of social contacts, worry, and loneliness.

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model for predicting the mental health state of university students. The data for this project is derived from Kaggle Open Datasets. The prediction is based on age, sex, years of study, marital status, and study success of students. The data was collected by an open survey during August 2020. The dataset contains a survey of 101 university students, including the timestamp that the data was collected, gender, age, study track, year of studies, GPA, marital status, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and whether the student seeked help.

With this project, we wanted to explore how different supervised machine learning methods are able to predict the mental health status based on different features. Namely, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree methods were applied to predict the binary label of either having mental health issues or not.

This Jupyter Notebook contains all data handling and analysis we conducted during this project.
